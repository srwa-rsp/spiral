Spiral

## Overview

Spiral is a self-discovery and personal growth platform inspired by Spiral Dynamics Theory, a model in developmental psychology. It features a unique test to identify a user's current level of ego development, generating a comprehensive profile and recommending tailored actions and learning paths aligned with their personal goals

### Problem

Most self-help apps on the market fail to offer genuine self-discovery tools, especially those based on the transformative Spiral Dynamics Theory. I believe that authentic growth and change begin with a deep understanding of oneself, supported by a clear vision and roadmap. Spiral addresses this by facilitating true personal development through insightful self-discovery.
